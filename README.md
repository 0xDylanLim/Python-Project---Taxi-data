The purpose of this project is to investigate and understand the data provided.

The goal is to use a data frame constructed within Python, perform a cursory inspection of the provided dataset, and inform team members of your findings.

This activity has three parts:

Part 1: Understand the situation

How can you best prepare to understand and organize the provided information?
Part 2: Understand the data

Create pandas data frame for data learning, future exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical activities

Compile summary information about the data to inform the next steps

Part 3: Understand the variables

Use insights from your examination of the summary data to guide a deeper investigation into variables


#1 - Taxi Data

The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (New York City TLC), has hired the Automatidata team for its reputation for helping their clients develop data-based solutions.

The team is still in the early stages of the project. Previously, you were asked to complete a project proposal by your supervisor, DeShawn Washington. You have received notice that your project proposal has been approved and that New York City TLC has given the Automatidata team access to their data. To get clear insights, New York TLC's data must be analyzed, key variables identified, and the dataset ensured it is ready for analysis.

This Python code investigates and understands the data in the initial stage of the data analysis process.


#2

You have just started as a data professional at TikTok.

The team is still in the early stages of the project. You have received notice that TikTok's leadership team has approved the project proposal. To gain clear insights to prepare for a claims classification model, TikTok's provided data must be examined to begin the process of exploratory data analysis (EDA).

A notebook was structured and prepared to help you in this project. Please complete the following questions.


#3 - Waze

Your Waze data analytics team is still in the early stages of its user churn project. Previously, you were asked to complete a project proposal by your supervisor, May Santner. You have received notice that your project proposal has been approved and that your team has been given access to Waze's user data. To get clear insights, the user data must be inspected and prepared for the upcoming process of exploratory data analysis (EDA).

A Python notebook has been prepared to guide you through this project. Answer the questions and create an executive summary for the Waze data team.
